    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Sreekar, a passionate individual with a zest for life. By day, I delve into the world of technology and code, but beyond the screens, I find joy in my two favorite hobbies. As the sun sets, you'll often catch me on the cricket field, where every match is a thrilling adventure and every shot is a story. Off the field, my ears are tuned to the captivating world of podcasts. Whether it's exploring new ideas, learning from experts, or getting lost in fascinating stories, podcasts are my constant companions. Join me on this journey as I share my experiences, thoughts, and the simple pleasures that make life truly extraordinary. </p>
